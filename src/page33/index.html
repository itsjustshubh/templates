        The neon lights of the bustling space station flicker as you make your
        way through the crowded marketplace. Cyborgs and androids jostle for
        position alongside human merchants, all selling their wares in a
        symphony of sound and color. You pause to admire the sleek lines of a
        hovering hoverbike, its thrusters humming with energy. This is a world
        of advanced technology and gritty streets, where anything is possible -
        for the right price.
